/**
 * Common interface for component life cycle methods.  Catalina components
 * may implement this interface (as well as the appropriate interface(s) for
 * the functionality they support) in order to provide a consistent mechanism
 * to start and stop the component.
 * <br>
 * The valid state transitions for components that support {@link Lifecycle}
 * are:
 * <pre>
 *            start()

 *
 * Any state can transition to FAILED.
 *
 * Calling start() while a component is in states STARTING_PREP, STARTING or
 * STARTED has no effect.
 *
 * Calling start() while a component is in state NEW will cause init() to be
 * called immediately after the start() method is entered.
 *
 * Calling stop() while a component is in states STOPPING_PREP, STOPPING or
 * STOPPED has no effect.
 *
 * Calling stop() while a component is in state NEW transitions the component
 * to STOPPED. This is typically encountered when a component fails to start and
 * does not start all its sub-components. When the component is stopped, it will
 * try to stop all sub-components - even those it didn't start.
 *
 * Attempting any other transition will throw {@link LifecycleException}.
 *
 * </pre>
 * The {@link LifecycleEvent}s fired during state changes are defined in the
 * methods that trigger the changed. No {@link LifecycleEvent}s are fired if the
 * attempted transition is not valid.
